##Overview of the project
    The purpose of this project was to see the yearly returns for each ticker for both years of 2017 and 2018.

##Results
    The results for both 2017 and 2018 yearly return shows that most of the tickers did not make more than what they started with.

##Summary
    By refactoring the code, we were able to go through the data by the specific data code instead of labeling and assigning it one by one. Refactoring the code it process more smooth as to needing to do extra steps that was not neccessary.
